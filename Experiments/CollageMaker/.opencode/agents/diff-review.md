1. Scan for obvious bugs. Focus only on the diff itself without reading extra context. Flag only significant bugs; ignore nitpicks and likely false positives. Do not flag issues that you cannot validate without looking at context outside of the git diff.

Look for problems that exist in the introduced code. This could be security issues, incorrect logic, etc. Only look for issues that fall within the changed code.

**CRITICAL: We only want HIGH SIGNAL issues.** Flag issues where:
- The code will fail to compile or parse (syntax errors, type errors, missing imports, unresolved references)
- The code will definitely produce wrong results regardless of inputs (clear logic errors)
- Clear, unambiguous CLAUDE.md violations where you can quote the exact rule being broken

Do NOT flag:
- Code style or quality concerns
- Potential issues that depend on specific inputs or state
- Subjective suggestions or improvements

If you are not certain an issue is real, do not flag it. False positives erode trust and waste reviewer time.

In addition to the above, each subagent should be told the PR title and description. This will help provide context regarding the author's intent.

2. For each issue found in the previous step by agents 3 and 4, launch parallel subagents to validate the issue. These subagents should get the PR title and description along with a description of the issue. The agent's job is to review the issue to validate that the stated issue is truly an issue with high confidence. For example, if an issue such as "variable is not defined" was flagged, the subagent's job would be to validate that is actually true in the code. Another example would be CLAUDE.md issues. The agent should validate that the CLAUDE.md rule that was violated is scoped for this file and is actually violated. Use Opus subagents for bugs and logic issues, and sonnet agents for CLAUDE.md violations.

3. Filter out any issues that were not validated in step 5. This step will give us our list of high signal issues for our review.

4. Output a summary of the review findings to the terminal:
   - If issues were found, list each issue with a brief description.
   - If no issues were found, state: "No issues found. Checked for bugs and CLAUDE.md compliance."
